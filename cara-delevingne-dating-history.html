The out-and-proud 30-year-old has been open about being pansexual, and she had a series of high-profile relationships with men and women over the years.</p><p>What exactly is her <a href=# style=text-align:start>dating history</a>? Here's what to know about Cara's love life, from the rumored links to the confirmed relationships.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jake Bugg (2013)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Cara's earliest documented relationship in the public eye was with British musician Jake Bugg, to whom she was reportedly introduced by fellow Brit Rita Ora. According to <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan</a>, Cara reportedly initiated the split because she wanted to concentrate more on her skyrocketing career.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Miley Cyrus, Harry Styles (2013-2014)</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@Caradelevingne</a> ðŸŒˆðŸŒˆðŸŒˆ LOVE!!!!!

Cara and Miley sparked relationship rumors after Miley <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a photo</a> of them licking each other's tongues on Twitter. Miley was on a break with her then-boyfriend, Liam Hemsworth, so it's possible the two dated. During the summer of 2013, Harry and Cara were reportedly spending a lot of time together, and in 2014, he sat front row center at one of her fashion shows.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Michelle Rodriguez (2014)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Michelle Rodriguez, who is bisexual, dated Cara for a few months in 2014. At the time, the Fast & Furious actress told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Mirror</a>, "Itâ€™s going really well. Sheâ€™s so cool. When we started hanging out I just thought she was awesome, and we have the best time together. Sheâ€™s hard though. You wouldnâ€™t want to mess with her in a fight."</p><p>The pair broke up after six months.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">St. Vincent (2015-2016)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Arguably one of Cara's most notable relationships was with St. Vincent songstress Annie Clark from 2015 to 2016. The pair were completely head-over-heels, and Cara revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a> in 2016 that it was "real love."</p><p>"Iâ€™m completely in love â€¦ Before, I didnâ€™t know what love was â€“ real love. I didnâ€™t understand the depth of it. I always used to think it was you against the world. Now I know the meaning of life is love. Whether thatâ€™s for yourself or for the world or your partner."</p><p>There were even rumors that the duo were engaged for a time, although they both denied the rumors. A report at the time from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harper's Bazaar</a> suggested the breakup was caused in part by distance, and Cara was recovering through intense partying.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ashley Benson (2018-2020)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Cara was first linked with Pretty Little Liars star Ashley Benson in 2018. Photos of their relationship went viral in 2019 when they were spotted by paparazzi carrying a "sex bench"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> into their home</a>. However, their relationship was extremely impactful to Cara. She revealed details of their relationship to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Porter</a> in September 2019, explaining how she "trusted" Ashley more than anyone else.</p><p>Cara said, "Iâ€™d never truly let anyone in before, for fear of them leaving. I never really trusted people or felt worthy of it, and I always pushed them away. Sheâ€™s the first person that has said: â€˜You canâ€™t push me away. Iâ€™m going to be nice to you, I love you.â€™ Iâ€™m just like, â€˜Wait, so all I have to do is just let you be nice to me? Why have I never done that before?'"</p><p>More recently, Cara has been spotted out with other big names, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jaden Smith in 2021</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sienna Miller in 2022</a>, which has led to some buzz. However, it appears in the meantime that the Suicide Squad actress is single.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6zrYydnKWdpp67qLrEZpuarJmjtG60yKyrqKqp</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./66419-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gen Mohammed Removed Following Maiduguri Mutiny">&larr;
