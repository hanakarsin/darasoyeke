I got them for you."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @rigoandrosa</span></figure><p>"You bought me these?" she asks as she places the bag on a sweater and begins to open the bag up further.</p><p>"Yeah," he says after she pours them out on the sweater and inspects them on camera.</p><p>"He bought me these," she says, looking at the small rings. "These are used," she then states, closely inspecting the jewelry with an incredulous tone in her voice.</p><p>Rigo states that he purchased them as a set. "Look at this, they came in this little velvet bag," he states before dropping the pouch back on the sweater.</p><p>"You did not buy me this," she states again.</p><p>"Ungrateful," he tells her.</p><p>"First of all I can't see your group chat. Second of all this is in your luggage."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @rigoandrosa</span></figure><p>"Yeah," he tells her.</p><p>"Where did you buy me them? Where?"</p><p>"I forgot I got them in Chicago for you..." he tells her.</p><p>"But where did you buy them?" she asks again, prompting him to tell her specifically where he purchased the jewelry.</p><p>He scratches his arm and then begins to squint. "In like some little downtown area."</p><p>"OK where, what store?"</p><p>"I don't know, they were just a little knickknack store, you know," he says, starting to laugh.</p><p>She begins to laugh too. "A little knickknack store?"</p><p>"Do you like 'em or not?" he says, laughing.</p><p>"Whose are they?" she prompts again.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @rigoandrosa</span></figure><p>She then asks to see his phone and he tells her that he doesn't know where it is at the moment before the video ultimately ends.</p><p>In a follow-up clip, Rosa records herself laying down and recording her man after he conveniently "found" his phone. She repeatedly demands he hand it over to her as he just looks at her and smiles.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@rigoandrosa href=#>@rigoandrosa</a><p>Tell him to let me look through it real @Rosa&Rigo quick <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=couplestiktok href=#>#couplestiktok</a> <a title=couplescomedy href=#>#couplescomedy</a> <a title=toxicos href=#>#toxicos</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ BRINN IT GRR - shawtybaenessx" href=#>‚ô¨ BRINN IT GRR - shawtybaenessx</a></figure><p>Viewers noticed that she was wearing the rings on her finger, but multiple people pointed out that the rings on her fingers weren't intended for hands; they were actually for toes.</p><p>Numerous commenters remarked that she should "run" away from the relationship, as Rigo got her wearing another woman's foot jewelry on her hands and uploading couples-themed TikToks about his supposed infidelity.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @rigoandrosa</span></figure><p>What do you think? Is this a classic case of "I don't want to know" and Rosa really just wants to believe her man isn't doing her dirty so she'll convince herself that toe rings are meant for her fingers? Are the two of them just manufacturing drama because they know that gets clicks? Or do you think he honestly got her a gift, but simply didn't know that they were toe rings?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mnaKmlKh6q7HWnqOrsV2eu26uzrKdq6GVo7G0ecuunqCZl5o%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./262197-aliyekuwa-kiongozi-wa-wanafunzi-apigwa-na-makanga-hadi-kufariki-azikwa-huku-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Aliyekuwa kiongozi wa wanafunzi apigwa na makanga hadi kufariki azikwa huku familia ikidai haki (pic">&larr;
