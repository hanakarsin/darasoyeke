It was like a welcome present because I saw that party (APC) being punished for that act of sacrilege.”</p><p>“The two parties (APC and PDP) have become very confusing to start with. Members have moved across so much. There has been so much inter-marriage and the bloodline has diluted in many aspects, being polluted in many aspects.</p><p>“It even got to a stage where a prominent member of the APC actually articulated the sentiment of ‘Oh, come and join us and your sins will be forgiven’.</p><p>“It didn’t surprise me too much that somebody who has been so heavily implicated in the death of a prominent member of that party, Bola Ige, he is a founding member, that his memories should be so thrashed by consulting one of the prominent figures who featured in the events – forget whether he was innocent of the actual crime or not – was heavily implicated in the humiliation of that individual, that founding member of that party who was also the minister of justice of this nation.</p><p>“To actually catapult one of those crime suspects and proven contributors, and to find that that person has been given a position in that party (APC), in governance, and after the President (Muhammadu Buhari) had actually inaugurated a re-examination of that episode amongst other crimes, that is quite a bit of shock. And I mentioned at a time, that is a bit of sacrilege. And remember, this Osun is Bola Ige’s state.”</p><h2>APC Loses Osun To PDP</h2><p>The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Sunday, July 17 <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>declared</a></strong> the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), <strong>Ademola Adeleke</strong> as the winner of the Saturday, July 16 Osun governorship election.</p><p>Adeleke defeated the incumbent governor of the state and governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), <strong>Gboyega Oyetola</strong> and thirteen other candidates.</p><p>The PDP candidate won 17 local government areas in the state, while the candidate of the APC, Oyetola won the remaining 13 local government areas in the state.</p><p>The incumbent governor of the state who was defeated in the election gathered 375,027 votes, while Adeleke polled 403,371 votes to win the election.</p><p>The INEC returning officer for the Osun State Governorship election, <strong>Prof Oluwatoyin Temitayo Ogundipe</strong> gave the declaration in the early hours of Sunday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5FsZpqok2K5sL%2FSZqCnZZ%2Bowq950q2YrZ1drK60ecuiop5lkWLEprjCqKSeZaCnsrSxza1kraddorJuv86yoKejkWQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./takeru-kobayashi-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="ESPN Gives Fans a Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Kobayashi vs. Chestnut Nathan's Hot Dog Rivalry">&larr;
