Fans Are Still Rooting for Her</h1><p class="sc-hUhoKJ ieqoZy">After getting approved for weight loss surgery, the COVID-19 pandemic struck, which put a damper in Seana's progress.</p>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jhDJkI eZknfg">Jennifer Farrington</a><p class="sc-ensa-Dq fPmIpI">Jun. 5 2024, Published 8:01 p.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>In Season 8, Episode 9 of <a href=#>My 600-lb Life</a>, which aired on Feb. 26, 2020, viewers are introduced to Seana Collins, a 23-year-old Kansas City native whose weight is at 660 pounds. "Every day of my life feels like it's harder than the last and like things keep getting worse for me because of my size," she says upon introduction, adding that she doesn't "want to look this way" and feels "like [she's] trapped most of the time because of how hard it is to move and get around."</p><p>Now, several years after filming, viewers are given a glimpse further into Seana's journey. In Season 9, Episode 5 of <a href=#>My 600-lb Life: Where Are They Now?</a>, which aired on June 5, 2024, we see Seana make major progress only to relapse during the COVID-19 pandemic and <a href=#>fall back into her unhealthy eating habits</a>. So, how is Seana doing now? Keep reading for everything you need to know about her progress on the show.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Seana Collins was on the verge of losing her "ability to move and do things" upon meeting Dr. Now.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>Seana feels "like a monster just walking around" and hates her body "more than anything in the whole world." She might be one of the youngest cases we've seen on the show, and she explains that a lot of her early weight gain came from the fact that she was raised in an abusive home.</p><p>"I've had a really hard life," she says, "and I feel like it's just been chaos since I was born." Her dad would abuse Seana mentally and physically, and she came to turn to food for comfort from an early age. "Eating made me feel like I was going to be OK, like nothing got worse," she says.</p><p>At 8 years old, Seana weighed more than 150 pounds, at 10, she had put on another 100 pounds and weighed more than 250 pounds. "Kids started making fun of me for how big I was," she says of not having friends. "My perspective was that I had food as my friend and didn't need anyone else," Seana shares.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Weight was just part of Seana's downward spiral.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>By the time she reached high school, Seana weighed 400 pounds and the teasing got so bad at school that she decided to drop out at the age of 16. But having nothing to do at home led to a depression spiral, and soon her mother committed her to a mental hospital.</p><p>For the following year, by Seana's account, all she did was eat food. But she also invited a man she met online to move in with her, and through his dependency, Seana too became addicted to meth. "It was a downward spiral until my mom came and got me," she recalls. Seana checked herself into a mental hospital once again, and after her release, continued eating to cope.</p><p>So, by the time we meet her, Seana's situation is dire. Her mother takes her down to Houston, where <a href=#>Dr. Now</a> is based and he essentially predicts upon their first meeting what we see unfold over the next hour and a half on screen. "My concern about Seana right now," he says, "is that she doesn't seem too motivated to start turning her life around."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Does Seana lose weight in Dr. Now's care?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>It's honestly impressive how Dr. Now can identify the patients that will end up losing weight from those who won't in the first few seconds of meeting them, and it's especially wild because everyone enters his office talking the talk and saying all the right things.</p><p>Anyway, back to Seana. As Dr. Now predicts and despite the words that come out of her mouth, Seana isn't committed to turning her life around. As seasoned viewers know, Dr. Now requires his patients to prove their commitment to him by losing weight on their own in the first few months of treatment — and only then does he give the green light for gastric bypass surgery. In short: Seana never does.</p><p>At the weight check-in required around the two-month mark, Seana just bails. "I was too scared to go," she says. Why? Because she has misplaced <a href=#>Dr. Now's diet</a> printout and "was too scared of what he would say" to ask for another.</p><p>Dr. Now, as you can imagine, isn't happy when she finally does arrive a few months later. Instead of losing 40 pounds per month, she has lost only one pound.</p><p>Seana misses her six-month appointment as well, and Dr. Now decides that she needs to fly down to Houston because her weight is clearly not losing itself. That's the first time we see Seana lose any weight — she drops 35 pounds. "I've never lost that type of weight before," she confesses with excitement. At this point, viewers are led to think that she might just have the best character arc and plot twist of the season.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>But that's sadly not the case. Seana begins therapy, at Dr. Now's suggestion, but that leads to her reverting to old coping mechanisms (binge eating) to deal with the topics that therapy is bringing up. By month 10, she had only lost 25 pounds and by month 12, she had put on more weight. Dr. Now decides to release her from his program but gives her the option to return in six months if she can start making some progress.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>In her My 600-lb Life: Where Are They Now? episode, we see Seana a year and one month after her initial visit with Dr. Now making significant progress. Not only is she exercising and swimming, but also cutting her portions in half and keeping up with therapy with Dr. Paradise. Three months later, after proving to Dr. Now that she could lose 50 pounds, he approves her for surgery. But the excitement is short-lived.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Where is Seana from 'My 600-lb Life' Now?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>These days, Seana keeps a very low profile, with no sign of her on social media. Therefore, we don't know if she ever lost the 300 pounds she strived to get rid of or if she ever underwent weight loss surgery. You see, with COVID-19 hitting right at the time when Seana was making the most progress, she wasn't able to undergo surgery two months after getting approved.</p><p>Two years and seven months after starting Dr. Now's program, Seana's weight spiked and she weighed more (730 pounds) than she did when she first met him. Two months later, she shared that she has been depressed since being denied surgery. While Seana admits that she isn't sure that she has it in her to continue with Dr. Now's program, we're hoping she was able to turn things around for the better.</p><p>Stream past episodes of My 600-lb Life and My 600-lb Life: Where Are They Now? on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLKiusBmpLJlZmV9brjBZqOinpViu7DD</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./where-does-garcelle-beauvais-live.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Garcelle Beauvais' New ZIP Code Isn't 90210 but Her House Sure Is Nice">&larr;
