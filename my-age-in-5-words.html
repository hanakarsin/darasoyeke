Users of the social media site are summing up their ages with just five words, plus a little visual cue, and the results are giving us life while also making us feel super old, even those of us who haven't cracked 30 yet. Check out some of the best answers to the hashtag and see which cohort you belong to.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">1.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>If you grew up with this person, you no doubt recognize these less celebrated Disney titles, but in case you didn't, they are (counterclockwise from the top left): Atlantis: The Lost Empire, Brother Bear; Emperor's New Groove, and Treasure Planet. Spanning 2000 to 2003, these ones definitely fell in between the spans most fans consider the high points for Disney Animation Studios. But hey, is it really such a tragedy that Disney took a step back from princesses for a few years to try outside-the-box spins on classic tales and mythology?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">2.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Anyone who was a teen in the '90s can relate to the impatience of waiting for your dial-up to connect to the internet — and screaming at your siblings when they would pick up the phone while you were online, thus disrupting your connection and kicking you off. Just typing out what internet access was like before high-speed internet makes it sound like the Stone Age.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">3.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>While the Nintendo Switch still involves a cartridge of sorts, it's the size of an SD card, and other consoles either use discs or downloadable content. But if you grew up in the 1990s, you recall a time where these bulky things were necessary to play a video game. And sometimes they'd get glitchy, so you'd take them out and blow on them to clear away the dust. And then you would have to walk to school barefoot in the snow, uphill.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">4.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>All these kids today with their Google Docs and their cloud don't know what it's like to have the anxiety of losing hours of hard work. And people who grew up with floppy drives can recall how scary it was to have a literal semester of your scholastic efforts stored on a disc smaller than a slice of bread. And even if you didn't lose it, your disc could break of get corrupted some how. So stressful.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">5.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>One of my first jobs at 19 years old was at Blockbuster Video, which is a very old-fashioned thing to say, <a href=#>unless you live in Bend, Oregon</a>. By the time I worked there, however, pretty much all the movies were on DVD, which was good news as much for customers as it was for yours truly. I didn't have to spend hours rewinding tapes on some dusty, rickety machine, and you didn't get a fine for forgetting to rewind.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">6.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>If you think video tapes are retro, get a load of this, the bygone "portable music player" children of the 1980s grew up with. It played cassettes about the same size as an iPod Mini, which is also insanely outdated technology at this point. I feel like I need a walker just thinking about this.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">7.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>This is the first game console I ever owned and honestly, in a lot of ways it's still the best — even if you did have to blow on the cartridge to get it to work sometimes. There's nothing more satisfying than landing Mario at the top of the flagpole and timing it just right so you get six fireworks.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">8.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>If I close my eyes I can see myself in my car with one of these riding shotgun. I always envied people I knew who had a CD changer in their car so they could have several discs lined up to switch between during a long car trip. Now we can just shout "Hey Siri, play Lizzo!" whenever the mood strikes. What a time to be alive!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">9.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Raise your hand if you a) had this phone and b) drained your battery playing Snake for hours? Sure, you can still play it on Android phones, but it's just not as satisfying as pressing the keys on your Nokia 3310.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">10.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Honestly? I think if kids aren't passing paper notes in class, they're truly missing out. Not only did we get to flex our awesome origami skills, but there's nothing like the exhilarating rush of getting away with getting it into the hands of your bestie or crush without detection. But I guess with that thrill also comes the possible consequence of having your teacher confiscate it, or worse, read it aloud to the class.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">11.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Can still sing the Preamble. <a href=#>#MyAgeIn5Words</a> <a href=#>#SchoolhouseRockRules</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/IAYtSCiydn</a></p>— shauna (@goldengateblond) <a href=#>July 9, 2019</a></figure><p>Any Gen Xers in the house will feel this one. Schoolhouse Rock was a staple of childhood for kids of the '70s, though I also definitely had a few teachers a couple decades later who liked to pull these timeless treasures out from time to time. So even if I am not old enough to remember when these aired on TV, I too learned about how a bill becomes a law from those cartoons.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">12.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>I too played these every day at one point in my life, but I get a feeling this Twitter user was a bit younger than I was when Nintendo DS was all the rage. (I was in my 20s.)&nbsp;</p><p>If you're baffled by what you're looking at here, those games are (clockwise from the top left): Mario Kart DS, Animal Crossing, Nintendogs, and Brain Age. All addicting in their own special ways.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">13.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>I'm wondering if this person is in fact 39 years old, but it sounds about right. While a bit younger than that, I remember seeing estimated download times like this when I was — there aren't any cops reading this, are there? — pirating music on Napster. Thankfully in a few years I'll finally have that MP3 of "Semi-Charmed Life" by Third-Eye Blind.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">14.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>“And you’re watching Disney Channel!” <a href=#>#MyAgeIn5Words</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/DuL4HxMvZb</a></p>— Amanda (@amandaabplease) <a href=#>July 9, 2019</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>This is so specifically linked to an era in childhood for people who grew up on Hannah Montana, Lizzie McGuire, and That's So Raven. These promos came out in 2002 in case you're racking your brain — and starred pretty much every legendary Disney star of the early 2000s.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">15.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Unless you were some sort of cool person with a social life on Friday nights, this was your life in the 1990s. If you actually remember Dinosaurs, well hello person in my age group. And if the show low-key scared you, I think we might just be best friends.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">16.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>OK, so this is really six words, but I had to include it because it's otherwise perfect. Let's all pretend the caption is just "My first friend was Tom" instead. If you've lot contact with your friend Tom, trust that he's out there living his best life. After selling MySpace to News Corp in 2005 for $580M, he's basically retired and travels the world taking stunning photos and posting them to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, not MySpace.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfosZurcaeZKKmXWp6uLvRnao%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./bandits-are-terrorists-and-should-be-treated-as-such-akeredolu-declares.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bandits Are Terrorists And Should Be Treated As Such">&larr;
