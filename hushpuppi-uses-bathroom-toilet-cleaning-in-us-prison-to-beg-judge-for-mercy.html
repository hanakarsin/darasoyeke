Wright is scheduled to hear the sentencing arguments of the prosecution and defence on September 21 before delivering his judgement in the matter.</p><p>In August, the United States Government commented on the rejection of the application by the Nigerian Government seeking permission to extradite the detained Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Abba Kyari,</strong></a> to the United States of America.</p><p>In a short statement obtained by journalists, the US Department of Justice said as a matter of policy, it would not comment on the case until Kyari is successfully extradited.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> understands that the spokesperson, US Department of Justice’s Senior Communications Advisor for International Law Enforcement, <strong>Nicole Oxman</strong>, made the disclosure to newsmen via an email.</p><p>Oxman wrote, “As a matter of policy, the US Department of Justice generally does not comment on extradition-related matters until a defendant is in the United States.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e49xZqGto529trzPomSuq5WoeqOt06GpqKedYsGwtcueq2abnJqur7XNoGSipl2qwG680aKqqKZdqbxursSgZKOtlJyybrLOq2SmnaKYxnA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./272777-mfuasi-sugu-wa-raila-mama-orange-atiririkwa-na-machozi-alipotembelewa-na-seneta-wa-jubilee-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mfuasi sugu wa Raila - Mama Orange - atiririkwa na machozi alipotembelewa na seneta wa Jubilee">&larr;
