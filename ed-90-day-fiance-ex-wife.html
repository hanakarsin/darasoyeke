Despite the fact that Ed has become a meme for the show and the entire internet is clearly not a fan of their relationship, we’ve continued to watch the trainwreck that is their romance.</p><p>While the couple is no longer together, Ed was hoping to find love with Rose, though he once found love with another woman: his ex-wife. Who is <a href=#>Ed’s ex-wife</a>, and why did they get a divorce?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ed from '90 Day Fiancé' cheated on his ex-wife.</h2><p>“<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It didn’t work out</a>," Ed says on the show of his previous marriage.</p><p>Before coming on 90 Day Fiancé, Ed was married to another woman named Sandra, and she’s the mother of his daughter, Tiffany.</p><p>“She’s the best thing that I have created on this earth,” he says of his daughter.</p><p>Ed admitted that his previous marriage only lasted two years. Why?&nbsp;</p><p>“Because I was unfaithful,” Ed says on the show of his relationship with Sandra. “It was just a stupid mistake.”</p><p>He goes on to explain that despite his failed marriage, his daughter is what has kept him going all of these years — and it’s because of her that he avoided dating for so long. Since his divorce from his ex-wife, Ed admits that he hasn't dated much, and he believed he was never going to marry again. Rose was his first serious relationship in years.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>With Tiffany’s mom throw backs..</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Big Ed</a> (@thisisbiged) on May 4, 2020 at 1:35pm PDT</p></figure><p>It wasn't his previous infidelity that led to Rose's decision to leave Ed, though.
