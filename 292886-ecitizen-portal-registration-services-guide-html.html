As you can all recall, before the eCitizen portal was created, accessing government services was a challenging task filled with state bureaucracy concerns not forgetting the long queues Kenyans had to endure. All this has been transformed as Kenyans no longer have to travel longer distances or wait in line for hours to get government services. The public can now comfortably apply for all government services at the comfort of the offices, homes or cyber. Moreover, payment for such services has also been simplified removing bottlenecks like bribing of government officials that was quite rampant in the past. Therefore, how can we define eCitizen?
