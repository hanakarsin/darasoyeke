Our strongest supporters are the oppressed, the downtrodden, and those who have been denied education and health care.</p><p>“Across the country, whether in the North or the South, we enjoy a lot of support from the people. But you may be right to say that we have more support from the South but we enjoy support generally from across the country because people try to bring tribalism and ethnicity into all of this, but it is no longer standing because the average voter today is more enlightened than we thought they were, and today it’s just not an issue of ethnicity.</p><p>“Like <a href=# rel=noopener>Peter Obi</a> would say, and as I have always emphasised, those in the North do not buy garri cheaper than those from the South. Hunger knows no tribe. Today, the number of out-of-school children is higher in the North than even in the South. When President Goodluck Jonathan was in office, he created Almajiri schools and removed Almajiris from the streets. He wasn’t a Muslim. He wasn’t from the North. But he did all of that.</p><p>“At this point, it is not about where you are from though the political oligarchy in Nigeria has been using ethnicity and tribalism to create a divide to continue to remain in office. I think that is coming to an end in 2023, and those are the issues that we have discussed to say that the 2023 election is not about where you are coming from.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Naija News</strong> </a>also gathered that while speaking about the recent attack on the party’s flag bearer, Peter Obi by the Anambra State Governor <a href=# rel=noopener>Charles Soludo</a>, the <a href=# rel=noopener>Labour Party</a> chair observed that “The opinion of Governor Charles Soludo is a minority opinion and should be treated with a pinch of salt. He’s not speaking the mind of Anambra. It is a minority and myopic point of view, and the people of Anambra — even without consulting them — can say clearly that it is not a popular opinion, and that’s why I’m saying that.</p><p>“By the time we take our campaigns to Anambra State, which will be very soon because of his comment, Anambra State will be the state that we take our campaigns to so that we can test our popularity and see who owns the land. My candid advice to him is that he should tone down his comments because he would be destroying his future and himself if he continued along these lines.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5JpZmtoYmh6sMHRZqqtqp%2BjtKm7y51koqtdnLKvsdGao6WxXam1pnnPnqappJVivKd5zaKenqqZlnqtrcGorKtloJa%2FtcWMnJ%2BaoaJisaavy5qpnqtf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./apc-crisis-dont-be-arrogant-orji-kalu-sends-strong-warning-to-party-leaders.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="APC Crisis: Don't Be Arrogant">&larr;
