From the <a href=#>fake Facebook messages claiming your friend has passed away</a> to the <a href=#>cryptic text messages from Netflix claiming that you're getting a free year-long subscription</a>, living in a chronically online world is getting more and more dangerous.</p><p>But here's the thing. With many scams, a lot of the illicit activity is going on privately. The scammers are wreaking havoc behind their computer screens. They may tell you that you need to enter your credit card information for some seemingly innocuous reason, but it's really so they can get into your account unknowingly. You're not aware that you're handing them over money.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>But in other con cases, you may be totally aware that you are donating or giving money to another party. However, what you're not aware of is that the party youâ€™re giving money to doesnâ€™t actually need it. Take the case of this woman who faked cancer to scam $55,000 dollars through crowdfunding.</p><p>On that note, one <a href=#>TikToker</a> reportedly just tried to pull a fast one on his followers. Unfortunately for him, his mom walked in at the perfect time to shatter his alleged deceitful pursuit.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">A guy allegedly scamming his followers over TikTok live pushed his mother away as she tried to expose him.</h2><p>â€œThis guy just got exposed for trying to scam all of his viewers on TikTok," said creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@ivangtv</a> in a video. In his video, he shows a screen recording of creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@mr.badkarma101</a> (previously known as @Hellcat_Whippa) during a TikTok live.</p><p>During this live, in which over a thousand people were watching, @mr.badkarma101 appeared to be emotional. However, it wasn't clear what he was upset about.</p><p>Then, a woman who we learned was his mother walked into the room as he was live streaming. â€œI just got a phone call that you were in your room on TikTok and you said that you had to get out by tomorrow," she is heard saying to him.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@ivangtv href=#>@ivangtv</a><p>This guy is a scammer <a title=scammer href=#>#scammer</a> <a title=tiktoklive href=#>#tiktoklive</a> <a title=momsoftiktok href=#>#momsoftiktok</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a> @Hellcat WhippaðŸ˜ˆ</p><a title="â™¬ original sound - IvanGtv" href=#>â™¬ original sound - IvanGtv</a></figure><p>@mr.badkarma101 immediately became irate when he saw her enter his room. He told her to leave and seemingly pushed her out.</p><p>As @ivangtv explained, @mr.badkarma101 had told his followers that his mom was kicking him out of the house. And because of that, he was asking others to send him money so he could get his own place.</p><p>However, from the way his mom reacted in the video, there didn't seem to be any truth to @mr.badkarma101's sob story. He was just a con man caught in the act.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: tiktok</span></figure><p>In the comment section of @ivangtv's video, viewers were distraught â€” but not over the fact that @mr.badkarma101 tried to take other people's money. Instead, they were heartbroken by how @mr.badkarma101 treated his mother.</p><p>While it's understandable that he would be mad at her for blowing his cover, his behavior seemed beyond disrespectful.</p><p>"Ok but how dare he talk to his mom like that," wrote one person in the comments.</p><p>Another user pointed out that he pushed her, which only makes you wonder how he treats her when the camera isn't on.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: tiktok</span></figure><p>@mr.badkarma101 has yet to address his scamming incident, and based on his behavior, he probably never will. It's also unclear if any users actually gave him money. For their sake, we hope they didn't.</p><p>As one person wrote in the comments: "This is why I don't donate money to people on the internet." Perhaps this is a cautionary message we should all abide by.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnMK6ecKarKCgpGLApK3MpqCnn12lsrC8y55kqKZdqbaswM6k</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1232110-morgan-freeman-net-worth-age-height-religion-happened-hand-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Morgan Freeman net worth, age, height, religion, what happened to his hand?">&larr;
