Later, he joined the cast of All That with his future co-star, Kel Mitchell.</p><p>Not long after <a href=#>Kenan and Kel</a> came to an end in 2000, Kenan began his 15+ year run on SNL and the sketch comedy veteran has been consistently bringing the funny ever since.</p><p>Over the years, he’s done impressions of dozens of celebrities including Steve Harvey, Al Sharpton, and Ben Carson, and he shows no signs of slowing down.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>In an exclusive interview with Distractify, Kenan talked about his longstanding history on the show and dished on his dream road trip with his SNL castmates. Read on to learn more.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Kenan Thompson leaving ‘SNL’? Kenan still has a few celebrity hosts on his bucket list.</h2><p>Kenan hasn’t given any indication that he’s leaving SNL anytime soon. According to the Kenan star, he still has more than a few celebs on his SNL bucket list. Kenan said among others, he’d love to see <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Smith</a> and Brad Pitt take the stage.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>“Thank God we had Chadwick [Boseman] come through there. But Angela Bassett and Denzel Washington — I think it'd be a lot of fun,” Kenan told Distractify. “You know, people that, when it when their name pops up, you would automatically assume that they've already done it. If they haven't been [on SNL], it's time to get them up in there.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kenan Thompson talks life before ‘SNL’ after almost two decades on the show.</h2><p>Kenan has come a long way since his days of Nickelodeon stardom, but he never forgot where he came from. Kenan bought his first car less than a decade before he joined the cast of SNL, which was “a major thing” for him at the time.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>“The first car I bought was a Toyota Frontrunner in like 1996. I was beyond proud of it because I thought that they were very cool,” he shared. “The back window rolled down — that was like the coolest part about it. I was just patting myself on the back for being able to afford to buy myself a car.”</p><p>He added, “I was 18 and I could actually make that decision for myself so I feel very grown in that moment. And the freedom of having your own transportation is life-changing.”</p><p>Kenan said that buying his Frontrunner was his first act of independence. Now, he’s teamed up with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Autotrader</a> to give others the same opportunity with the click of a button. With Autotrader’s app, car buyers can choose their preferred vehicle from the comfort of their own homes.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by christina evangeline 🌿 (@yoevangeline)</a></p></figure><p>Kenan previously copped a family-friendly SUV for daily use, but he shared that he and his wife might be in the market for a new Winnebago soon. And Autotrader will certainly come in handy, as Kenan shared, “Oh man, we've been trying to get a good road trip going.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, which ‘SNL’ cast mates would Kenan bring along on his dream road trip?</h2><p>Kenan and his wife previously discussed taking a road trip with her friends. But if he were to travel by RV with any of his SNL castmates, it would definitely be Cecily Strong and Aidy Bryant.</p><p>“And I need a few of my brothers,” Kenan added. “We need Chris [Redd]. We need Bowen [Yang] to have just all the laughs in the world,” he shared. “Ego [Nwodim] likes to eat so I know will be covered on that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBut8SnmKdlpJ28rrzSqKVmpJWWw6q6xmaqp6Q%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./309657-lawyer-karanja-kabage-dead-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nairobi lawyer Karanja Kabage is dead">&larr;
