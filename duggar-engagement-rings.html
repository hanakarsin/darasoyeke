The details, however, tend to get a bit fuzzy after a while. So let's take a look back at all of the Duggar engagement rings through the years — because each one is gorgeous in a special way.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Anna Duggar</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>Jim Bob and Michelle's first child to pop the question was Josh when he proposed to Anna. Although the eldest of their 19 children was eventually kicked off the TLC reality show — after<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> two different scandals</a> came to light — his engagement to Anna began in the typical fashion: with a ring. Josh presented Anna with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">.5 carat diamond ring set on a white gold band</a>.</p><p>They tied the knot in September 2008 and have seven children: Mackynzie, Michael, Marcus, Meredith, Mason, and Maryella, and Madyson.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jill Duggar</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Jill and Derick Dillard officially got engaged on March 29, 2014 — and the camera crew was there to capture it all for 19 Kids & Counting. Derick ended up giving Jill a .63-carat diamond solitaire set in a white-gold band that he'd custom designed. "I shared how much I loved her, how I couldn't imagine life without her, and I asked her, 'Will you marry me?'" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Derick told People</a> at the time.</p><p>Jill and Derick married in June 2014 and now have three sons together, Israel, Samuel, Frederick.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jessa Duggar</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>In August 2014, Ben Seewald gave Jessa a custom-designed engagement ring that featured an interlocking band — and she didn't hesitate to share the details via Instagram. "My beautiful engagement ring!" she captioned the post. ".75 carat diamond--18 karat gold band. Gorgeous!"</p><p>Jess and Ben walked down the aisle that November. They currently have four children, Spurgeon, Henry, Ivy, and Fern.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jinger Duggar</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>Jeremy Vuolo picked out an engagement ring with the help of his brother-in-law, Ben Seewald. Jinger's engagement ring features a cathedral setting and is reportedly .75 carats.</p><p>"Jeremy definitely did amazing on the ring that he picked out for me," she said while grinning from ear to ear and displaying her new bling, during an episode of Counting On.</p><p>They ended up marrying in November 2016 and currently have two daughters, Felicity and Evangeline.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Joy-Anna Duggar</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Austin Forsyth proposed to Joy-Anna in March 2017. He did so with a more complicated engagement ring — which included side stones — than her sisters' suitors. Like many Duggars before her, Joy-Anna didn't waste any time walking down the aisle with Austin; they married in May 2017.</p><p>These days, they have one son, Gideon, one daughter, Evelyn, and a baby boy on the way.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kendra Duggar</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Although Kendra hasn't posted any close-ups of her bling, the engagement ring from Joseph appears to be a more-complicated ring that includes a band studded with diamonds. Joe proposed to Kendra at Joy-Anna and Austin's wedding — with his sister's permission, of course.</p><p>They married in September 2017 and have two children: a son, Garrett, and a daughter, Addison.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lauren Duggar</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The engagement ring Josiah picked out for his wife, Lauren, has been one of the most unique Duggar choices yet. When <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Josiah popped the question in March 2018</a>, Lauren received a square-cut diamond that appeared to be set in multiple bands.</p><p>&nbsp;The lovebirds tied the knot that June, and they currently share one daughter, Bella.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Abbie Duggar</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Speaking of unique engagement rings, Abbie and John David got engaged in July 2018 — and her ring is simply stunning. The band is lined with diamonds — and the main, large diamond is also lined with diamonds. Then again, John David married relatively later in life than most of his other siblings, so he had longer to save up for an expensive engagement ring. (Get a closer look at Abbie's gorgeous ring in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this slideshow</a>.)</p><p>John David and Abbie married in November 2018 and have a daughter, Grace, and a son, Charlie.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jed and Katey Duggar</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p><a href=#>Jed and Katey Nakatsu</a> announced they married in April 2021 without having made a public engagement announcement. We later learned the proposal happened that February — and have since gotten glimpses of Katey's engagement ring via Instagram. Her ring features a diamond set in a rose gold band that appears to fit into her wedding band.</p><p>They went on to welcome a baby boy <a href=#>they named Truett Oliver Duggar</a> on May 2, 2022, and are expecting a daughter in May 2023.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jeremiah and Hannah Duggar</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p><a href=#>Jeremiah Duggar and Hannah Wissmann</a> got engaged in January 2022.
