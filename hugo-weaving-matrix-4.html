The trailer has revealed a slew of new characters along with some very familiar faces in not just Reeves, but Carrie-Anne Moss as well.</p><p>However, fans of the sci-fi series noticed that there were some beloved <a href=#>Matrix</a> staples missing from the fourth installment, like Agent Smith, played by Hugo Weaving. So will Hugo Weaving be in The Matrix 4?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Warner Bros.</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Hugo Weaving in 'The Matrix 4'?</h2><p>Unfortunately, Hugo Weaving will not appear in The Matrix Resurrections. The Nigerian-born English actor stated in an interview with T<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ime Out London</a> that he was unable to appear in the film due to a prior theater commitment. He's starring in The Visit, a play written by Tony Kushner that centers on a revenge plot.</p><p>It's a real bummer because his character, Agent Smith, is such a huge part of the original series.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Agent Smith in the 'Matrix' movies?</h2><p>Playing a computer algorithm with a singular purpose is a pretty tough role for an actor to pull off in an interesting way. But Hugo Weaving managed to do it in the Matrix series. While in the first movie he serves as an "agent" tasked with destroying rogue programs, in the follow-up films, he becomes an "exile" program, a full-blown computer virus.</p><p>What audiences were presented with was less of a cold, calculating computer program and more of a deranged, sinister, and self-serving individual who, by virtue of attempting to enact his own free will, basically contradicts his very hatred of Keanu Reeves' character Neo. Whoa.</p><p>Interestingly enough, Smith's character becomes a metaphor for "conformity" and living one's life for others.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Since we’re all talking about The Matrix, reminder that Agent Smith is one of the best villains because his motivation is that he hates his job. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/GyQRpg7yVu</a></p>— James Reinhardt (@JamesReinhardt) <a href=#>September 9, 2021</a></figure><p>He carries a hidden emotion. And that emotion is hate. In the first film, he has a hatred for humanity; he describes humans as "self-replicating viruses" whose only goal is to destroy their environments and move on to the next ecosystem to repeat the pattern.</p><p>This is pretty ironic, considering what happens to Agent Smith.</p><p>He becomes a computer virus and copies himself ad infinitum to different programs and "blue pills" in the Matrix, basically rendering them copies of himself. He becomes the very thing that he has criticized humanity for, but the difference between Neo and Smith is the singular characteristic that distinguishes humans from machines — a potential for love.</p><p>Smith's hatred comes from either his unwillingness or inability to love, which is why he wants to destroy that emotion for others, hence his work in the Matrix to destroy everything around him.</p><p>Neo, on the other hand, is full of love, not just for the fellow humans he's attempting to rescue, but in the relationship with Trinity. The only thing Neo's trying to get people to "conform" to is a life full of love.</p><p>It's real hippie stuff for a movie all about machines and gun violence.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Laurence Fishburne is also missing from the cast of 'The Matrix 4.'</h2><p>Also missing from The Matrix 4 is Laurence Fishburne, who says he was not invited to be in the movie but wishes everyone involved in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">project great success with it</a>.</p><p>But why didn't they invite Morpheus, one of the coolest characters from the flicks, back to the movie?</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon</a> thinks it might have to do with a story arc from an online Matrix video game that was released years ago. Seriously, an MMO might have something to do with it. Go figure.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The Matrix 4 trailer is lit. The new Morpheus is great but deep down I wish we still had Laurence Fishburne.
