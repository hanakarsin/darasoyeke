Before the closure, there are still ongoing rumors of the players who will be joining Arsenal or leaving. Emery has not hinted on the players he will be signing on official Arsenal transfers. However, he will need to revamp the team and restructure a lineup that will best represent his interest on the pitch, ahead of the 2019/2020 Premier League campaign.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/19d23702d5bd733b.jpeg><p class=align-left>Arsenal fans have already demonstrated their concerns by stating the players they wish to have in the squad come next season. Also, the soccer fraternity and other interested parties, including former players, have hinted on the need for upgrading the Arsenal defense lineup. However, the ball and final decision lie with Emery. So far, there has been an addition of six players to the squad since the entry of the new coach. According to Charlie Nicholas, the new signings were below average in boosting the team form.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c6bdf6d70899c7a5.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>EPL transfer rumours: Aubameyang, Sancho, Partey, Havertz & more</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Charlie termed them as "poor" Arsenal transfers as they lacked productivity and merely additional cost for the club. Arsene Wenger was keen during his time, keeping a close eye on the minimal budget while selling great players to add a new lot of underequipped ones. This trend has not changed with Unai Emery, as the January transfer was occasioned by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">lack of funds</a>, with only Denis Suarez joining the team on loan from Barcelona.</p><h2>Arsenal squad</h2><p class=align-left>Emery has once again admitted that he will be making further transfer business come this summer. In <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">one of theinterviews</a>, he stated that:</p>There could be a lot of movement in terms of signings and departures, or there could be little, but first of all, I believe there is a good base for the team already here. We are here today with the opportunity to achieve our objectives in both the Premier League and the Europa League, albeit knowing that it is going to be difficult - just as it has been since the start.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f98157affe9c46c3.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Fantasy Premier League tips, best players, and captains</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Unai Emery has taken a squad of 24 players, who will face Chelsea in the Europa League final.

Mesut Ozil</h3><p class=align-left><strong>Status: </strong>Leaving</p><p class=align-left>Ozil is one of the most controversial Arsenal players whose career under Emery seems to be constantly plummeting. The relationship between the two has been a sour one, with rumours that he will be exiting the club soon. Other than the displeasure by Unai over the player's underperformance, there is a struggle over the player's salary which does not settle well with the club's financial situation.</p><p class=align-left>Based on these two factors, there is a high chance that Mesut will not be featuring in the club's lineup come next season. However, Ramsey's exit puts the club on the receiving end of Ozil's demands as they look for a better replacement for the duo. He was included in the starting lineup of the team for the Europa League final on May 29, 2019.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9c6d70857292190c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Arsenal transfer analysis: List of all signings and departures</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Unai Emery includes five youngsters in Arsenal's 24-man squad to face Chelsea in Europa League final</p><h3>2.

Emerick-Pierre Aubameyang</h3><p class=align-left><strong>Status:</strong> Leaving</p><p class=align-left>Aubameyang has been nothing but phenomenal ever since he joined Arsenal from Borussia Dortmund. In the just ended 2018/19 Premier League season, he netted 22 goals and emerged one of the three Golden Boot winners. Gabon International has received many offers with excellent deals. Real Madrid is one of the clubs which has demonstrated an interest in the forward and are willing to engage Arsenal in a serious transfer deal. Other clubs include PSG and Juventus who will also be willing to offer the said transfer fee. With all these deals coming at a go, there is a high chance that the star will be one of the players to leave Arsenal.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Mesut Ozil reveals he will stay at Arsenal next season despite struggling under Unai Emery</p><h3>5.

After a tough season and most of the club's problems pointed to the defense, the star's fate is yet to be determined.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/81aca088525dccfc.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Liverpool transfer analysis: List of all signings and departures</span></p></a><h3>6.

In the just concluded 2018/2019 Premier League season, the star has had a total of 17 appearances, maintaining three clean sheets and scoring three goals. He is among the players whose time at the Emirates could have come to an end. This is after the poor season that saw them land at the fifth position, one point behind fourth-placed Spurs. He was named among the squad that traveled to Baku for the Europa finals, but this could be his last appearance.</p><h3>7. Rob Holding</h3><p class=align-left><strong>Status: </strong>Leaving</p><p class=align-left>Holding is a defender for the Gunners playing under the jersey number 16. The England international had only 10 appearances in the just ended campaign and scored no goal. Under his participation, the Gunners managed to maintain only one clean sheet.

The star was not named with the 24-man team that will be facing Chelsea at the Olympic stadium on Wednesday.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6dbe327a637eab15.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Complete football transfer news: Neymar, Hazard, Lukaku, Sarri and more</span></p></a><h3>8.

According to the Express, AC Milan is ready to offer a sizeable amount for the star as an exit deal.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/19983bd55f2cd0b1.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Premier League transfer news: Aubameyang, Griezmann, Coutinho and many more</span></p></a><h3>10.

In response to claims of his potential exit, the star mentioned that he was happy at Arsenal, and will be seeking to advance his career at the club. However, the defender will have to prove himself worthy of the lineup after he was named in the 24-man squad that traveled to Baku for the Europa finals.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/a47b7907ce68b7ad.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>German Bundesliga matchday 34: betting odds, picks, correct score and predictions</span></p></a><h3>12.

Carl Jenkinson</h3><p class=align-left><strong>Status: </strong>Leaving</p><p class=align-left>Jenkinson appeared only three times in the previous season and is among the three players who have been offered to Crystal Palace for Wilfred Zaha deal. Emery is not pleased with the star's performance and has opted to put him back on the market. According to the Express UK, Arsenal is willing to offer Carl Jenkinson, Callum Chambers, and Reiss Nelson in a bid to smoothen their deal with Palace for their forward Wilfred Zaha. With rumors of his possible exit from the club, it's undebatable that the star's time at the Emirates is finally over.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs2n9s7brv51qg.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Spain World Cup squad 2018</span></p></a><h3>14.

He made 25 appearances for club and scored one goal.

Emery has not shown any displeasure in the star and will be retaining him for next season's campaign. The 30-year-old has also indicated that he is happy under Unai's management and hopes to shine brighter come next season.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Robin van Persie finally apologises to Arsenal fans for joining Man United in 2012</p><h3>15. Mohammed Elneny</h3><p class=align-left><strong>Status: </strong>Staying</p><p class=align-left>Elneny is an Egypt international currently playing as a midfielder for the Gunners. In the last season, he had a total of eight appearances and scored no goal for the club. The injury-prone star is not one of Emery's favorites for the midfield role. However, given the club's struggling midfield form, the manager had no choice but included him in the 24-man squad that will be playing in the Europa finals. Also, given the star's potential to grow as a midfielder, there are chances that he will be staying at the Emirates for a little while.</p><h3>16. Alex lacazette</h3><p class=align-left><strong>Status: </strong>Leaving</p><p class=align-left>Lacazette's future at the Emirates remains shaky as Barcelona are in constant pursuit of the star. Although he will be playing for the Gunners against Chelsea this Wednesday, there are fears that it could be his last appearance for the club. He has been phenomenal under Emery and would be potentially joining the Catalan side this summer transfer. But with the Gunners failing to extend the loan deal for Dennis Suarez after the January loan deal, there are fears that the club may not find a suitable replacement anytime soon. As such, they will be trying to sweeten Lacazette's stay package, including salary increment and other captivating deals.</p><h3>17. Ainsley Maitland-Niles</h3><p class=align-left><strong>Status:</strong> Staying</p><p class=align-left>Niles career at the Emirates can be described as one that is fruitful. The midfielder is among the 24-man line up provided by Emery, ahead of the final clash against Chelsea at the Olympic arena. He made a total of 16 appearances for the club in the 2018/2019 EPL season and scored only one goal for the Gunners. He is one of the most successful Arsenal academy youngsters with a promising career at the club. There are no hints of a possible exit from the club both from himself and the manager.</p><h3>18. Lucas Torreira</h3><p class=align-left><strong>Status: </strong>Staying</p><p class=align-left>Torreira is an Uruguayan star who joined the Gunners under Unai Emery. He has had a total of 34 appearances in the EPL, scoring two goals and providing two assists. The 23-year-old midfielder has a potential future at the Emirates under Emery and will be staying. He will also be playing at the finals against Chelsea as the Gunners seek a Champions League entry through the match. There are still no bids for the player and Arsenal have not given any update on his possible exit from the club.</p><h3>19. Granit Xhaka</h3><p class=align-left><strong>Status: </strong>Leaving</p><p class=align-left>Xhaka joined the Gunners from Borussia Monchengladbach three years ago and since then has had a whopping 125 appearances for the club. In the latest transfer market updates, Inter Millan are already interested in the Switzerland international. Further, Unai has a significantly small transfer kitty with only 45 million pounds to spend for the summer window. If he has to increase the kitty, then he needs to offload some of the players from his squad. Xhaka's deal with Inter will be a welcomed opportunity for the Frenchman. Xhaka has also hinted that he needs to improve his career, which may involve moving out. In an interview, he stated that: "I am very ambitious … I want to take the next step."</p><h3>20. Danny Welbeck</h3><p class=align-left><strong>Status: </strong>Leaving</p><p class=align-left>Welbeck's career under Unai Emery has been shaky, with the star-making fewer appearances and scoring lesser goals than his time at Old Trafford. Despite featuring in the 24-man squad that traveled to Baku for Europa League finals, it might be his last appearance in the club. Lazio has already shown interest in the star and will be making their exit deal public once after the Wednesday finals clash. Other teams interested include Everton, Newcastle and West ham. According to the club, Welbeck's contract which expires on June 30 will not be extended.</p><h3>21. Aaron Ramsey</h3><p class=align-left><strong>Status: </strong>Leaving</p><p class=align-left>It's official that Ramsey will be leaving Emirates this summer transfer. According to the Sun, the star has will officially join Juventus on a free transfer deal. According to Raul Sanllehi, the head of football at Arsenal, Ramsey was let out on a free transfer deal as a way of maintaining the club's "rationality" in salaries. This will avoid imbalances that could damage the club in the long run. Ramsey's exit leaves a gap in the club's midfield. The strained transfer budget will mean the club has to seek more funds through other players' transfer deals.</p><h3>22. Callum Chambers</h3><p class=align-left><strong>Status: </strong>Leaving</p><p class=align-left>Chambers has been on loan at Fulham in the just concluded season. The star has been on poor form at the Emirates since the exit of Arsene Wenger. This could spell an end of his career at Arsenal. He is among the players who will be offered to Crystal palace to smoothen the transfer deal for Wilfred Zaha. Following the relegation of Fulham, Chambers' career may be taking a different turn at the Emirates. Other than the Palace deal, there is no mention of his future at the Emirates by the coach.</p><h3>23. Henrikh Mkhitaryan</h3><p class=align-left><strong>Status: </strong>Leaving</p><p class=align-left>After joining Arsenal from Manchester United, the injury-stricken star has had one of the worst seasons in his soccer career. He has started from the bench more times that he started from the first eleven and is now out of Emery's preferences going forward. There have been speculations that the star will leave the club this summer transfer window, but the next destination is yet to be unveiled. In one of the posts, he stated his frustration not being able to play for the side during the Europa finals clash against Chelsea. "I must admit that it hurts me a lot to miss it. I will cheer my teammates on, let's bring it home," he said.</p><p class=align-left>Emery has maintained that the club's performance is at the top of his priority. This entails revamping most of the practices and players he inherited from his predecessor, Arsene Wenger. Arsenal transfers this summer window will be occasioned by both entries of new players and exit of existing ones. In light of making his dream team, there will be signings and disappointing exit of players who have won the hearts of Arsenal fans over the years. Our list comprises player transfer based on stories from both official Arsenal transfer news and other trusted rumor mills online.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Arsenal star breaks down in tears as he bids fans goodbye at Emirates ahead of summer departure</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2Fj29vamxdlr%2B0sc2ao2asopa7tLLEq6pmr5ikerTAwLJkpZ2Rq7JvtNOmow%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1050384-first-jiji-conference-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="First Jiji conference: Achievements and perspectives">&larr;
