In November 2023, <a href=#>Modern Family</a> fans took a stroll down memory lane after most of the cast reunited, with many of the kids looking a lot older than viewers may have remembered.</p><p>Although almost every member of the cast was involved in that reunion, which was publicized in a group photo, many noticed that the actor who played Phil wasn't in attendance. What happened to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ty Burrell</a>, the actor who played Phil on the show?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Phil from 'Modern Family?'</h2><p>Ty Burrell played Phil, the patriarch of the Dunphy family, throughout the entirety of the show's run. He was absent during the reunion, and many noticed that the cast was holding a picture of the actor. The decision to hold a picture of Ty in his absence led many to wonder whether the actor had died.</p><p>"Umm...why are they holding a picture of Phil like that," one person wrote on Twitter under the picture of the reunion.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"Oh hell naw. For a second I thought Ty passed away and I didn't even know," another person added.</p><p>Although the cast holding Ty's picture made many people think that he had died, that's definitely not the case. The actor simply couldn't attend the reunion for whatever reason. So, they decided to hold a picture of him instead, almost to indicate to anyone who saw the picture that he was absent but not forgotten.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>It's unclear why Ty couldn't be at the Modern Family reunion, but given that the rest of the cast decided to hold a picture of him, it doesn't seem to be the case that Ty wasn't invited or didn't want to attend. What seems far more likely is that he had some sort of scheduling conflict that kept him from attending. There haven't been any reports that he is ill or injured. Ty has continued to work regularly in the years since Modern Family ended.</p><p>Although the actor isn't very active on social media these days, one of his more recent appearances was at the 2023 Kids In The Spotlight Film Awards at Paramount Pictures Studios on Nov. 04, 2023 in Los Angeles.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ty was lauded for his performance on the show.</h2><p>Modern Family was an awards juggernaut generally, and Ty was often one of the actors who was rewarded for his work on the series. He won the Emmy for best supporting actor from 2011 to 2014. He was nominated eight consecutive times over the course of the show's run.</p><p>Of course, Modern Family was hugely successful throughout the entirety of its run, and the reunion left many fans nostalgic for the series now that it has been off the air for three years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSpoJmheqe%2BzqZkpqeUmr%2BvecWapKKkqQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dorinda-medley-dorobics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What to Know About Dorinda Medleys Dorobics Classes">&larr;
