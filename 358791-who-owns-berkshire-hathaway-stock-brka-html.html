So, who owns the most Berkshire Hathaway stock?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/d60d2f7fbd41883f.jpeg><p class=align-left>Since it is a publicly listed company, Berkshire Hathaway's ownership is shared among stockholders who own the company's shares. However, the major shareholders are the movers and shakers where the company's interests are concerned.</p><h2>Berkshire Hathaway company history</h2><p class=align-left>Before we look at the owners, it is good to understand the history behind the company. Its roots can be traced back to 1839 when a businessman by the name Oliver Chance founded Valley Falls Company, a textile manufacturing company in Valley Falls, Rhode Islands.</p><p class=align-left>Nearly a century later, Valley Falls would merge with Berkshire Textile Manufacturing Company leading to Berkshire Spinning Associates. In 1955 another merger occurred, this time with Hathaway Manufacturing Company, leading to today’s Berkshire Hathaway.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/2b1f9b24250f8cc6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jamie Siminoff net worth in 2021: How much did he sell Ring for?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, it would take a long time before the company transformed from into its current form. The transformation all started in 1962 when Warren Buffett began buying its stock. In 1965, he acquired control of the company, which had been mostly involved in the textile industry. Two years later, he purchased National Indemnity, an insurance company, starting its transformation into a conglomerate.</p><p class=align-left>Today, Berkshire Hathaway is a multinational holding company with interests in multiple sectors: insurance, railroads, apparel, jewellery, furniture, jet rentals, media, and more. It has its headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska, and Warren Buffet is its current CEO and chairman of the board of directors.</p><h2>Current Berkshire Hathaway shareholders</h2><p class=align-left>Now that you know the company's history, here is a look at who owns the most of Berkshire Hathaway stock.</p><h3>1. Warren Buffett</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/2b1f9b24250f8cc6.jpeg><p class=align-left>How much Berkshire Hathaway stock does Warren Buffett Own? Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway are synonymous. Since taking over the company in 1965, Buffett has used it as his investment vehicle. He is considered one of the top investors in the world, with his transformation of Berkshire Hathaway from a textile company to a multinational conglomerate being a testament to this fact.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0a08d79ffd4d879b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 15 richest companies in the world and their net worth in 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Aside from being a successful investor and businessman, he is also one of the wealthiest people in the world, with a net worth of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$68.7 billion</a>.

As a result, it has a wide variety of products and services. They include:</p><ul><li>Diversified investment services</li><li>Insurance services</li><li>Restaurants</li><li>Food processing</li><li>Foods and beverages</li><li>Public utilities</li><li>Airline services</li><li>Real estate</li><li>Apparel and jewellery</li><li>Sporting goods</li><li>Internet</li><li>Toys</li><li>Home furnishing</li><li>Materials and construction</li><li>Media</li><li>Consumer products</li></ul><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Current owners of Aston Martin car company</p><h2>Berkshire Hathaway stock</h2><p class=align-left>In addition to looking at the top owners, it is also vital to gain a bit of understanding of the Berkshire Hathaway stocks. The company has both Class A and Class B shares. The Berkshire Hathaway stock class A has a current price of US $263,094.</p><p class=align-left>With most company shares going for tens or hundreds of dollars, this is quite a high price. So, why Berkshire Hathaway stock is so expensive? Well, there are two reasons for this. The first one is the company's consistent growth, which has seen the Class A <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">stock price rise</a> from $265 in 1980 to the current price.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/ff99018756c0af69.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How much is the Collier family worth in 2021? Wealth and sources of income</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The second reason is that the company has never split its Class A shares. Splitting of shares occurs when a company divides the existing stock to increase liquidity, usually to raise capital. Under Warren Buffett's leadership, Berkshire Hathaway has never split the Class A shares, and therefore their value has never dropped beyond the market fluctuations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0a08d79ffd4d879b.jpeg><p class=align-left>On the other hand, Berkshire Hathaway stock B price is a little lower, with the current price standing at $174.93.
