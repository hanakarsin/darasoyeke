It's Not Johnny "Bananas"</h1>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jYKDjX hHZJHw">Shannon Raphael</a><p class="sc-bxLYvs cnDLfX">Updated Feb. 12 2021, 11:22 a.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>After 35 seasons of MTV's <a href=#>The Challenge</a>, a multitude of competitors have made their careers by competing on the show. The reality competition includes high intensity (and sometimes dangerous) battles, and those who go on the show truly earn their prize money ‚Äî if they can even make it to the end.&nbsp;</p><p>The cash winnings have increased in recent years, which has made the stakes even higher than ever before.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">You might be surprised at who's won the most money on 'The Challenge.'</h2><p>While some have won a single season of the series, several stars have won multiple times, but only one alum of <a href=#>The Challenge </a>has made more than $1 million.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who has won the most money on The Challenge?</a> Read on for the list of the top earners. Though Johnny "Bananas" Devenanzio has won the show six times, he's not even in the top three.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">1. Ashley Mitchell ($1,121,250)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>While Ashley walked out on Day 1 on Season 30 of The Challenge and has had multiple seasons of less than stellar play due to causing drama in the house, she is the only competitor in the history of the franchise to have won more than $1 million.</p><p>She was the female winner for Invasion of the Champions, which served as her first win on the show.&nbsp;</p><p>Though she technically won Final Reckoning with partner Hunter Barfield, her finishing time put her in first place. When she was given the choice to split the $1 million prize money or take it all, she chose to be the sole winner for the season.</p><p>Ashley has won two Challenges ‚Äî which is less than some of the other competitors on this list ‚Äî but her controversial decision to take all the money for herself in Final Reckoning put her at No. 1.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">2. Jordan Wiseley ($833,000)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Often portrayed as the villain of the show, Jordan has won The Challenge three times. Unfortunately for him, he happened to win on seasons where the prize money was lower.&nbsp;</p><p>He and partner / ex Sarah Rice won Battle of the Exes II (more on Sarah later), and Jordan subsequently became one of the winners on both Dirty 30 and War of the Worlds 2. For War of the Worlds II, a team won in the finale, which meant that four people split the $1 million prize package.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">3. Turbai Camkiran aka Turbo ($750,000)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The Turkish Survivor competitor won War of the Worlds, and as the sole winner for the season, he got a hefty prize package of $750,000. He did get kicked off during Final Reckoning for fighting none other than Jordan Wiseley, and we haven't seen him on the show since.&nbsp;</p><p>Considering how much money he won on his rookie season on the show, he doesn't exactly need the series for a paycheck.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">4. Johnny "Bananas" Devenanzio ($684,720)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Bananas is undoubtedly the greatest champion ever to compete on The Challenge, since he won six seasons of the show. Most of his wins occurred in early seasons, and he won several times with a team, which explains why he has less than a one-season winner like Turbo.</p><p>The last time Bananas won the show was in Rivals III in 2016, when he decided to take the $275,000 prize money for himself instead of splitting it with partner Sarah Rice.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">5. Cara Maria Sorbello ($602,250)</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Smiling cuz Montana is slowly returning to life again.

She and cousin Jamie Banks won Battle of the Bloodlines, and they split the $250,000 winnings. She also won Vendettas, which was Season 31 of the show, and Champs vs. Pros. Cara Maria was a finalist on several other seasons too.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">6. Camila Nakagawa ($561,250)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>The Camilanator was equally as famous for her behavior in the house as she was for her performances in challenges. She hasn't competed on the series since she was the female winner in Dirty 30, which was when she won the majority of her prize money. Her first win was with Bananas on Exes II.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">7. CT Tamburello ($514,750)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>More than a decade after making his debut on The Challenge, CT is still considered to be one of the most intimidating players on the show. His first win was on Rivals II in 2013 and he most recently was one of the champions for Season 34's War of the Worlds II.</p><p>CT was the male winner alongside Ashley on Invasion of the Champions, and he was victorious on two seasons of Champs vs. Stars (which was for charity). He competed in the finals for five other seasons too.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">8. Wes Bergmann ($298,000)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Wes made the No. 8 spot on this list with two Challenge wins ‚Äî first on The Duel and then on Rivals II with partner CT. His appearances in five other finals earned him miscellaneous prize winnings too.&nbsp;</p><p>These days, Wes is as notorious for his feud-turned-friendship with Bananas and for being one of the most strategic thinkers on the show.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">9. Dee Nguyen and Rogan O'Connor ($250,000)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: MTV</span></figure><p>As members of Team Brit in Season 34, Dee and Rogan won their shares of the $1 million prize with Jordan and CT. Interestingly, in addition for sharing a spot in the Top 10, Dee and Rogan are also exes.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, this list might change once Season 35 of The Challenge concludes.&nbsp;</p><p>The Challenge airs on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWweceaqmavn6N6tbTEZqSoq6RiurC6xLJkqKZdqbWmecKhmKWklaO0pg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./woman-pretends-to-clean-up-beach-litter.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Woman Pretends to Clean up Beach Litter for Social Media">&larr;
