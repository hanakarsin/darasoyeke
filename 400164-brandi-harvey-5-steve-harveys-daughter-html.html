She is actively involved in her father’s projects, especially running the foundation. In family photos on Steve Harvey’s Instagram page, it is easy to spot her.

Most aspects of your family, whether good or bad, find a way to the media. Despite such challenges, Brandi Harvey has grown to become an admirable person who focuses on helping others.</p><h2>5 lesser-known things about Brandi Harvey</h2><p class=align-left>Brandi Harvey wears many hats. From an executive to an activist, she is actively involved in various fields. Despite having a <a href=#>rich celebrity dad</a>, Brandi has managed to carve out her own path. These are some of the little-known facts about Steve Harvey’s most outspoken daughter.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f954856f279dc598.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Wynton Brycelon Ali Harvey: 7 facts about Steve Harvey's son</span></p></a><h3>1. Brandi has a twin sister</h3><p class=align-left>Over the years, the press and public have confused Steve Harvey’s twin daughters. Brandi is an identical twin to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Karli Harvey</a>. Born in 1982, the two are the eldest of Steve Harvey children. In most of his earlier specials, Steve Harvey made many references to being a dad to twins.</p><p class=align-left>However, Brandi and Karli have had a complicated relationship with their dad. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to People</a>, Steve abandoned his daughters to pursue a <a href=#>career in comedy</a>. His choice of career broke the bond he had with Brandi and Karli.</p><p class=align-left>In recent years, Karli and Brandi Harvey have mended their broken relationship with their father. For example, Brandi is the executive director of her father’s foundation, while Karli is often spotted in Steve’s tours.</p><p class=align-left>Additionally, when Karli was getting married in 2015, Steve walked her down the aisle. The gesture was a public display that they have resolved their long <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">family feud</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/702e3694f8fb0240.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Meet Kris Kristofferson's children: names, photos and what to know</span></p></a><h3>2. Brandi Harvey grew up in a blended family</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f954856f279dc598.jpeg><p class=align-left>Due to Steve Harvey’s many relationships, Brandi grew up in a blended family. Apart from her twin sister and brother, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Broderick Jr</a>, she is a stepsister to Steve’s kids from other marriages.</p><p class=align-left>When Steve divorced her mother, Marcia Harvey, he married Mary Lee Harvey. The newlywed couple welcomed their son, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Wynton</a> in 1997. Unfortunately, the marriage did not last long. From this marriage, Brandi has one step-brother.</p><p class=align-left>After being single for close to ten years, Brandi’s father married <a href=#>Marjorie Harvey</a> in 2007. Unlike the previous relation, Steve does not have a child with his third wife. However, Marjorie came with three children — Jason, Morgan, and <a href=#>Lori</a>.</p><p class=align-left>For the past 15 years, Steve Harvey has tried to bring all his children together in a blended home setting. Although the TV star has been accused of negating Brandi and Karli from his blended family, the twins talk highly of their father. They share pictures of the blended family often to show that the family is intact.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/bb54b82766e56830.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Meet Steve Harvey's family: wife, ex-wives, and children</span></p></a><h3>3. She is a vegan and fitness enthusiast</h3><p class=align-left>Brandi is a <a href=#>vegan</a> and an advocate of purposeful living. Although she has never shared what drove her to this unique lifestyle, Brandi has been vocal about her choice. Ms Harvey believes that her decision is both a statement for animal rights and better living.</p><p class=align-left>A quick scroll through <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Brandi Harvey Instagram</a> will give the impression that the business lady is passionate about positive living. For example, in an Instagram post she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared in 2018</a>, Brandi was eating vegan ice cream. According to her, being purposeful with food and snacks should be everybody’s priority.</p><p class=align-left>Besides being a vegan, Brandi is one of the celebrities to own entities, for teaching people about the lifestyle. When she was transitioning to be a vegan, there was very little information about the lifestyle. Fortunately, through her business, <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Beyond Her</a></i>, she educates people, especially women of colour about purposeful lifestyles.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/5482574292cc6508.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mary Harvey: The untold story of Steve Harvey's ex-wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Brandi Harvey is also involved in campaigns about a good lifestyle. In most of her social media posts, Brandi argues that healthy living has two main advantages. Being intentional with food makes one feel good about them and look good.</p><h3>4. Brandi Harvey is single</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/702e3694f8fb0240.jpeg><p class=align-left>Is Brandi Harvey married? No. After her twin sister walked down the aisle, attention shifted to her relationship. However, unlike Karli, she has never posted pictures of any man apart from her father. She often dodges the related questions in interviews. It is, therefore, reasonable to conclude that she is single.</p><p class=align-left>Unlike Lori, her views on love and relationships are unknown. However, she is a positive person, contrary to how the media has portrayed her. In her book, <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Breakthrough Sold Separately</a></i>, she discusses several things. One of the key themes is <i>being hopeful</i> regarding life and opportunities. This approach shows her approval of love and, she may soon get married.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b00559c9e22eb964.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cody Heller: The untold story of Dan Harmon's girlfriend</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Since Brandi has a lot of time on her hands, she is involved in mentorship programs. Through her father’s foundation, she has been travelling to different parts of the world, mentoring girls and funding education. In the past five years, she has made <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">several trips to Ghana</a>, where she works with different girls’ schools.</p><h3>5. She is worth $5 million</h3><p class=align-left>How much is Brandi Harvey worth? <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to Celebrity Net Worth</a>, she is worth $5 million. Although Brandi’s association with Harvey has given her visibility, she is hardworking and smart.</p><p class=align-left>The value is mainly from her ventures and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">public speaking gigs</a>. Thanks to Brandi’s background in wellness and business, she has many gigs each year. She is also one of the most knowledgeable people in education matters. Her vast expertise in different niches makes her one of the most sought after celebrities to give speeches at events.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d6d73f021751e885.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Vanessa Arevalo: Quick facts about Cameron Mathison's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Brandi’s wellness initiative, which she launched in 2018, has contributed to her worth in the last two years. <i>Beyond Her </i>has also allowed the entrepreneur to branch off from her father’s brand. While the worth of the business is unknown, it is vital to her as a business personality.</p><p class=align-left>Besides her wellness company, Brandi runs the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Steve Harvey Mentoring Programs</a>. Although the foundation is a non-profit, it has a budget. Therefore, her role as one of the directors is a vital income source for the young executive.</p><p class=align-left>Although Brandi Harvey is one of the popular children in Steve Harvey’s family, little is known about her personal life. For example, her journey to purposeful lifestyle is less known. Besides that, most people may not distinguish between her and her twin sister, due to their striking resemblance and similar dressing styles.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> has listed down top 10 facts about Phyllis Fierro, who is George Macchio’s wife.
