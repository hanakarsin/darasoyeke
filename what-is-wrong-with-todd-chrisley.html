The TV personality details his recovery from the coronavirus.</h2><p>After falling extremely ill from the virus, Todd revealed that he reflected on the important things in life, calling his recovery from the disease "life-altering."</p><p>“I think that what it has taught me is to look around and see the things that truly, truly matter — and what matters is health,” Todd told listeners. “You can have all the money in the world but if you don’t have your health, you have nothing. It’s been a tough, tough three weeks.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Todd's wife echoed similar sentiments, and urged people to take this disease seriously. “Todd and I have been together for 25 years, I have never in 25 years seen him as sick as what he was in the past few weeks,” she said on the podcast. Adding, “If you are doubting or have not been affected by corona personally …There are people who are dying and we have to take it seriously. We have to practice social distancing, and we have to stay in if at all possible."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Savannah Chrisley opens up about her dad's coronavirus diagnosis.</h2><p>Todd's daughter Savannah Chrisley took to Instagram to share her experience as a bystander, watching her father battle with the coronavirus.&nbsp;</p><p>Her lengthy statement on social media detailed that her father was diagnosed nearly three weeks prior, and since then, her thoughts on the disease have changed.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>COVID-19: Dad was diagnosed with the coronavirus about 2.5 weeks ago..and I have never been so scared in my life. When everything started with COVID-19 I was like a lot of u...my mindset was “Wash your hands, don’t touch people, and you’ll be ok...” BUT BOY HAS THAT IRRESPONSIBLE MINDSET CHANGED! When dad started getting sick I immediately started worrying...he and I are the worriers of the bunch. After a couple days mom and I talked him into going to urgent care...he went in and he was showing all symptoms of COVID-19 so they tested him. Here in TN Vanderbilt was extremely prepared for testing and has testing at 15 or so of their walk in clinics. So before people say...”OH HE ONLY GOT TESTED BECAUSE HES A CELEBRITY...” u are WRONG! He went into an urgent care just like the rest of u would. After getting tested he went back home and stayed quarantined in his bedroom for 7 days and then his test came back..POSITIVE..when mom and I read that our hearts dropped. Dads symptoms were worsening as days went on..finally at 3am on a Sunday he woke mom up saying he has to go to the ER..he couldn’t fight it any longer. When she got there they made her drop him off and leave because of all the strict guidelines. He stayed at Vanderbilt for 3 days and those were the hardest 3 days I think I’ve ever endured. I talk to my daddy 10x a day! He’s my bestfriend...I also never go to bed a single night without a “Goodnight and I love you” text..and now my dad was sitting in a hospital room by himself and I had no idea how he was. At one point I fell on my hands and knees and begged God to not take him..to not take my bestfriend..I would give everything I had if it meant keeping my daddy. I was so desperate that I dropped photos of our family off at the hospital and said “If he sees these I know he’ll keep fighting!” So I guess the point of me telling u all this is so that u take it seriously...STAY HOME! SOCIAL DISTANCE! And most importantly..LOVE HARDER THAN EVER! Life is so short. I also owe a HUGE THANK U to my friends @charlesgalanismd @drjacobunger for walking me through all the steps we needed to follow and continuously checking in on us. As well as the drs and nurses @ Vandy❤</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Savannah Faith Chrisley</a> (@savannahchrisley) on Apr 8, 2020 at 7:15pm PDT</p><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>"He was showing all symptoms of COVID-19 so they tested him. ...
