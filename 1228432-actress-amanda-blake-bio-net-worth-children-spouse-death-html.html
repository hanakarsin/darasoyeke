It has been her main occupation for years. One could see her in such movies as:</p><ul><li>Cattle Town</li><li>Gunsmoke</li><li>Miss Robin Crusoe</li><li>Lili</li><li>Glass Slipper</li><li>Tattletales</li><li>Brothers</li><li>The Red Skelton Show</li><li>China Corsair</li><li>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</li><li>A Star Is Born</li><li>Never Trust a Gambler</li><li>Smuggler's Gold</li><li>The Family Secret</li><li>The Adventures of Hajji Baba and many others.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Her work was extremely productive, and therefore <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amanda Blake net worth </a>was estimated at $500 thousand at the time of her death in 1989.</p><p class=align-left>This actress is also a great animal lover. All people at least once have heard the name of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">organisation called PAWS</a>. Volunteers from this organisation help animals all around the world.

In 1967 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she met Pat Derby</a> (a co-founder of PAWS) during "Gunsmoke" filming. Pat worked as an animal trainer on the set and Amanda had a role of Miss Kitty. When in 1984 PAWS was founded, an actress donated a lot to the organisation and even left decent material support to the company when she passed away: she left her estate, a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$400,000 home</a> in Los Angeles, to Derby's animal refuge.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/29ac6d21422db390.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Fascinating facts about the talented Linda Hunt</span></p></a><p class=align-left>She also had 32 animals on her Phoenix property, including cheetahs, a lion and a kit fox.

So many people often ask “how old was Amanda Blake when she died?” <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">It happened in 1989</a> when she was 60 years old.</p><p class=align-left>Amanda Blake death was a tragedy for many people. The star died in Mercy General Hospital in Sacramento, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the reason was AIDS</a> with related symptoms of liver failure and CMV hepatitis. As it is known AIDS can be transmitted through unprotected coitus, from mother to child or through blood injections (those who take drugs often become AIDS victims). Supposedly, Amanda got this terrible illness from her last <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">husband Mark Spaeth</a> as long as he died at the age of 45 from AIDS (just a year after their divorce). Later a city council member revealed the details about the marriage:</p>“They had been good friends for years. The general perception was that Amanda was sort of down and out, in some financial difficulty, and that was the reason for the marriage. Mark was fairly well-off. He was definitely perceived as being gay. Mark was accepted as being gay, and his close friends were known to be gay.”<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e030b093f2b80433.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Unveil the most exciting facts from the biography of Fiona Shaw</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Amanda Blake was not only a talented actress but also a kindhearted personality. She was a woman who looked for love all her life and died when she should have lived more. Her biography helps people to keep in mind that this wonderful and charming lady, better known as red-haired Miss Kitty, existed and made this world better and brighter.</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnN%2Bl21qa2WRmMGzsdKsZJqlkaOxonnBpZiknV2XtrB5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpecKhoKWcopq7br%2FPqKysnV2ZsqLAx2efraWc</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./just-in-bola-tinubu-appoints-wamakko-masari-as-senior-advisers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bola Tinubu Appoints Wamakko, Masari As Senior Advisers">&larr;
